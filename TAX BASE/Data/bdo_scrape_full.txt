Title: International Investment: Financial management, governance and compliance

Description: Australia provides a reliable, strong and safe market for business, investments and growth.



As with all foreign jurisdictions, there are compliance requirements, localised governance norms and financial management practices that promotes or inhibits success.

	People, processes, systems and information

	Finance business partnering

	External financial audit readiness

	Key legislative frameworks.





We can help by supporting an establishment (or review of) a fit-for-purpose financial management practices that give confidence in compliance within Australia in addition to clear and insightful information reported back to head office.

In most instances the offers appear to be very attractive with high multiples (capitalisation rates) offered, but the devil is in the detail.

Description: “I came to BDO with a new and different idea. My leaders listened and now they share my passion, supporting me 100% and encouraging me to keep pushing the boundaries. Now I lead a service offering and have positioned myself as an expert in my chosen field.” William Tuffley, Associate Director, Business Services



What do you value about working for BDO?



The ability to provide my clients with the best quality service from a range of teams across the firm. Being able to tap in experienced and specialist knowledge is invaluable.



What attracted you to BDO?



On LinkedIn, I saw that BDO was doing some work with the Rugby Union Players’ Association. I’m very passionate about sport and helping sportspeople carve out a career and personal wealth after their career, so it caught my eye. After discussions with some of the team at BDO I quickly realised BDO’s values aligned with mine immensely.



How does working at BDO differ from where you have worked previously?



BDO is a lot bigger, providing me with access to a wealth of services and resources.



Do you think BDO lives its values?



Yes. They’re not just words that are set and left. Importantly, our people also ensure everyone in the firm is held accountable to stick to these values.



Which of your personal values aligns to BDO's values?



Playing sport since a young age and all the way into my thirties, I have always loved being part of a team. This is just how we operate at BDO, working collaboratively towards a common purpose with shared goals. On the sporting field I have seen the strengths and weaknesses of teams and how powerful it can be when a team is working in unison. We are definitely working as one at BDO.



How does it make you feel each day when working at BDO?



I thoroughly enjoy it. First and foremost because of the people I get to work with.



How would you describe the BDO culture in just three words?



Family orientated, team driven and client focused.



How does BDO support you to achieve your personal aspirations and career goals?



My leaders trust in my genuine passion to positively change the sporting landscape and provide me with the resources to help make it happen. They share my vision and support me 100%, so that empowers me to keep pushing the boundaries.



Has working at BDO provided opportunities you wouldn’t get working elsewhere?



I have been given the unique opportunity to focus on my passion by leading a sports specialisation and making a difference in the sector I am so connected to. I can combine my two passions - sport and helping people – and there is not much more I could ask for!



How does BDO empower you to keep thinking outside the box and put innovative ideas forward?



BDO and its people listen and respond to any idea appropriately. No one flicks your idea to the side if you are passionate enough about it and truly believe in it.



How do your ideas help your clients?



Thinking differently lets me come up with new ways to help my clients. This keeps them passionate about what they are doing and allows them to focus on their career with confidence around their financial future, making their ‘life after sport’ transition significantly easier.



The BDO values I most identify with are:



ONE – We work like a sporting team at BDO, working collaboratively towards a common purpose with shared goals.



STRIVE and BOLD - Thinking differently lets me come up with new ways to help my clients.



HUMAN – BDO and its people listen and respond to any idea appropriately. No one flicks your idea to the side if you are passionate enough about it and truly believe in it.

Title: Jeshan Velupillai - My career at BDO 
Date: 27 September 2021 
Description: “BDO's leaders put a lot of trust in me. I'm regularly presented with situations to personally and professionally grow. I'm empowered to shape my own journey.” Jeshan Velupillai, Director, Audit & Assurance



What do you value about working for BDO?



BDO has provided me with continuous personal and professional development, global opportunities and no two days are the same.



Since I started here, there has always been a focus on structured continuous development through regular technical and soft skill training for all levels. Your performance manager works with you on short term and long term personal goals and you receive real-time 360-degree feedback from colleagues and Partners for each engagement, allowing you to understand where you can work better to consistently improve.



I have also been fortunate through my time to go on international secondment as well as work on multiple international clients, which has allowed me to travel with BDO to the United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand. BDO lives its values, in fact my international secondment was arranged at the same time my wife was going on secondment with her firm. This is something I have always appreciated as we were able to share a global experience together. Global opportunities have also taken me outside of my comfort zone and allowed me to understand how business is conducted in international markets. With our clients becoming more global this is a strong attribute for them, because I have demonstrable experience I can put into action to assist with their needs.



At BDO, no two days are the same. I work across a few different industries including financial services and United States engagements. I also work with multiple service lines, including corporate finance, tax and advisory, as well as a multitude of clients and other colleagues. My days are so varied. One day, I may be presenting at a board meeting with a Partner and then heading to a client to discuss the upcoming engagement with a CEO and CFO. Another, I could be working on a proposal/tender for a potential client, working with colleagues and other service lines to solve a complex technical issue, or working with People & Culture and other managers to hire new starters.



What attracted you to BDO?



Two things specifically attracted me to BDO. The first, is when I started there was a slogan, ‘Distinctly Different’. I thought it was very powerful and resonated with me as I interpreted it in a way that the goal was to always put its people and its clients first compared to other firms. This makes up part of our brand promise in client delivery and something that has continued throughout the time I have been here. I honestly believe there is a direct correlation to this and the success and growth of BDO in my seven-year tenure.



The second attraction to BDO was the people I met during the interview process. The People & Culture team, managers, Partners and staff members were all so positive and genuine. This was an indicator to me that BDO’s values and culture weren’t just words on wall or in a flyer, the people genuinely enjoyed working here and lived the values.



How does working at BDO differ from where you have worked previously?



I genuinely believe you are in control of your own destiny with BDO. Hard work has a direct and tangible output on your continuous development and continued progression. Innovation is also a part of the BDO DNA - if you have a great idea we are encouraged to voice it - particularly around how we can continually improve an engagement, the operations of a service line or generally contribute to enhancing BDO.



One example of this was when, as a graduate, I and another graduate came up with an idea to implement a buddy program across the audit service line for new graduates. We felt there was a real opportunity to leverage graduates’ knowledge six to twelve months into their careers and then set up a structured program to pass on that knowledge to the new graduates coming in. We ended up presenting the idea to the CEO and Head of Audit as well as other Partners. This was refined with them and then implemented across the BDO service lines and continues to this day. As a result of this, and my performance on engagements during my first few years, BDO nominated me for an Australia-wide industry award (2015 Thomson Reuters Tax & Accounting Excellence Awards - Graduate of the Year). I was fortunate to win the award and this is something to this day I am extremely proud of.



Do you think BDO lives its values? If so, how?



Yes, it certainly does. Collaboration is encouraged and you see this when service line teams work as one with clients to achieve success. BDO is bold by responding to change rather than being reactive, and the firm acknowledges we are all humans. Being genuine, honest and authentic means we have connected with our clients on a deeper level. BDO strives to continually grow and improve, demonstrated by our entry into new industry groups, with the aim of being leaders across key topics and areas. Finally, our firm cares about giving back. We are encouraged to be stewards in our community and care for each other, which is evident through the way we empathetically work with and deal with clients and each other.



Which of your personal values align to BDO’s values? Why is this important?



If I had to pick two, I would say HUMAN and STRIVE. Being human means being authentic, empathetic and honest in all interactions. This is very important to me because at the end of the day we are all humans and we should all be treated respectfully. I love getting to know people, their story, and their business and have a genuine interest in helping in any way I can. To STRIVE is to continually improve and be better. This is something I try to do myself each day, whether at work or in my personal life.



How does it make you feel each day when working at BDO?



I feel immensely proud to work at BDO. I believe it is an organisation that talks the talk and walks the walk. There’s opportunity in each day to develop professionally and personally and I enjoy working and collaborating with my colleagues and clients.



How would you describe the BDO culture in three words?



Collaborative - Working together with colleagues and clients to achieve successful outcomes.



Nurturing - Willing to invest in its people and continually develop and nurture their talents and opportunity to continually grow with the organisation.



Inclusive - Diversity is a focal point and we can always learn something from others to continually improve and develop as an organisation.



How does BDO support you to be a successful leader?



BDO provides me with continuous internal and external training programs to develop as a leader and I have access to Partners and various initiatives to participate in, observe and learn from others.



Why do you think your clients trust you, and how do you build and demonstrate that trust?



I believe I bring technical expertise and honesty when dealing with clients. I am passionate about what I do. I build trust by listening to my clients and understanding what they want to achieve. Being a continuous learner in the industry also helps to constantly build trust as a technical expert by speaking knowledgably about various areas. Engaging with clients and being available is crucial to a successful working relationship. I demonstrate trust by keeping my commitments to my clients and being available to them.



How do you know BDO and its leaders trust you?



I know BDO and its leaders trust me because they continually put me in positions to grow personally and professionally. They trust me in my role and want to see me continually progress through the firm, which is very empowering.



The BDO values I most identify with are:



STRIVE - Our people continually strive to grow and improve.



HUMAN - We are encouraged to care for each other and our clients.



ONE - Collaboration brings opportunities to grow.

Title: Michelle Sutherland - My career at BDO 
Date: 01 August 2021 
Description: “My clients see me as their trusted adviser, the person they rely on to get them where they want to go. I know my work makes a difference - for me, my clients and BDO. I have the luxury of working for a big firm, but without the big firm mentality.” 



Michelle Sutherland, Associate Director, Business Services





What do you value about working for BDO? 



I love working for BDO because I get challenged, I feel valued and there is always a very client-centric focus. 



What attracted you to BDO? 



I liked the idea of a big firm without the big firm mentality. 



How does working at BDO differ from where you have worked previously? 



I have been fortunate to work at some amazing smaller firms prior to BDO, but what sets it apart is the focus on culture and recognition of employee achievements. 



Why have you stayed with BDO? 



The people - our people and our clients. Every day is different. There are challenges, of course, but when you have great people around you it’s easier to turn those situations into positives. 



Do you think BDO lives its values? 



Absolutely! I think our COVID-19 response taught us all many lessons. During the early lockdowns BDO showed that our values weren’t just words, they were actually the way our leaders tackle problems and interact with their clients and people. 



Do your personal values align to BDO’s?



I think all of my values align to BDO’s, but if I had to choose only one it would be the focus on striving for success. It’s important for me to work for an organisation that prides itself on its integrity and delivering the best possible outcomes for clients because, personally, that’s why I do what I do. 



How does it make you feel each day when working at BDO? 



Excited! There’s usually a sense of anticipation because you never know what you are going to be faced with. I like that. 



How would you describe the BDO culture in just three words? 



Inclusive, fun, and collaborative. 



As a female leader, what makes working at BDO rewarding for you?



It’s really satisfying to know that I have helped someone, whether that’s a client or another staff member. I also enjoy knowing that I have the support of not only my team, but the firm as a whole. This is demonstrated strongly in BDO's flexible working arrangements. Most importantly, I value that my efforts are recognised for what they are. I’ve never felt like I’ve been rewarded to fill a quota and for me that is so important.



How does BDO support you to be a successful leader? 



Coaching and training are obvious answers, but at BDO it’s more than that. The firm has supported me by giving me enough room to fail (and not fear failure) and the chance to turn those failures into valuable learning opportunities.  



Why do you think your clients trust you? 



I am authentic in my relationship with them. I listen and take the time to get to know them. I do what I say I will do, so they know I am dependable and always supportive. 



How do you know BDO and its leaders trust you? 



I have the freedom to work in a way that works best for myself, my family and our clients. They ask for my input and ideas on projects, and communicate with me openly and honestly. 



The BDO values I most identify with are:



STRIVE - BDO prides itself on its integrity and delivering the best possible outcomes for clients.  

HUMAN - BDO is a big firm without the big firm mentality. 

ONE and HEART - The way BDO’s leaders tackled the COVID-19 pandemic with their people and clients shows our values are not just words.

William Campbell, Partner, Tax





What are you passionate about as a Partner? 



As a Partner I am passionate about helping my clients in all facets of their business, whether that be helping them navigate through the complexities of the tax landscape, providing my views on broader industry and business issues, or co-developing commercial solutions.  



What do you value about working for BDO? 



I value the spirit of partnership displayed at BDO and the emphasis placed by all of our leaders on the development and nurturing of our teams so they can aspire to reach their own professional and personal goals. 



What attracted you to BDO?



I’m excited to join the BDO family – the relentless drive for excellence in all we do, the focus on our team delivering on our shared vision and strategy and the fun and energy displayed is nothing short of inspiring.

Title: Gita Kumar - My career at BDO 
Date: 01 August 2021 
Description: “At BDO, I always have a voice and it’s a voice that is heard. My clients value my opinion and advice, and my leaders regularly seek out my insight. There is so much value to be gained from a conversation and at BDO I am encouraged to keep talking.” Gita Kumar, Associate Director, Audit





What do you value about working for BDO? 

For me, it’s the appreciation I get and the trust my leaders have in me to manage my clients.  



What attracted you to BDO? 

I wanted to work for a chartered accountant firm and BDO stood out to me as one that approached things differently.  



How does working at BDO differ from where you have worked previously? 

The main difference at BDO is the open door policy we have. You can easily go and approach the Partners, in fact you are encouraged to do so! At my previous places of work we were expected to approach our immediate manager first.  



Why have you stayed with BDO? 

The culture, the team environment and the opportunities I have been given are the key things for me.  



Do you think BDO lives its values? 

Definitely. We have a great culture and a working environment that’s supportive and inclusive.  



Which of your personal values aligns to BDOs values? 

At BDO, we are authentic in our interactions with each other and we are free to communicate openly, honestly and respectfully. This is really important to me because I think if you can connect with people and understand them it will help you in the long run. 



How does it make you feel each day when working at BDO? 

It feels satisfying, like I am making a difference. 



How would you describe the BDO culture in just three words? 

Inclusive, agile and flexible. 



As a female leader, what makes working at BDO rewarding for you? 

I am recognised and valued for the work I do, and I am given equal opportunity to succeed. The flexibility I have with my work pattern allows me to balance my family life and work, something that is very important to me. 



How does BDO support you to achieve your personal aspirations and career goals? 

We have the support of our leaders to achieve our development goals and the firm also has formalised channels of support, including dedicated mentors, team activities and training, and firm events.  



Has working at BDO provided opportunities you wouldn’t get working elsewhere? 

BDO has a unique blend of size, expertise and local relationships, so I’ve been lucky to be able to specialise in audit and assurance, while also working with a wide variety of clients. 



I make it my priority to visit them as often as I can, have casual conversations, catch-up for coffee and, most importantly, call them rather than email. There is so much more value that can be derived from a genuine conversation. 



What do you do to ensure you deliver exceptional client service?

I work hard to establish a strong relationship with my clients, ensuring I understand them and their needs. Equipped with that insight I apply my skills to deliver solutions customised for them. 



The BDO values I most identify with are:



HUMAN - Connecting with people so you understand them and their needs will help you in the long run. 



STRIVE - I am recognised and valued for the work I do, and I am given equal opportunity to succeed. 



HEART - You can easily go and approach the Partners, in fact you are encouraged to do so!

Title: Income Tax: Character of Receipts in Respect of Software - Meaning of ‘Royalties’ 
Date: 07 July 2021 
Description: The ATO released draft Taxation Ruling (TR) 2021/D4 (draft ruling) on 25 June 2021. The draft ruling outlines the Commissioner of Taxation's view as to when certain types of software-related payments would be considered royalties for Australian income tax purposes (and therefore possibly subject to royalty withholding tax). However, for the purposes of Australia’s double tax agreements, the definition may be overridden by the definition of 'royalty' in the agreement.



This is an area where existing guidance has not kept pace with technological change. The prevailing guidance prior to the issuance of the draft ruling was nearly 30 years old (TR 93/12 Computer Software now withdrawn). Unfortunately, while the digital economy and the associated tax consequences were somewhat simpler in 1993, the landscape is somewhat more complicated in practice today, which results in the new draft guidance also being more complicated than TR 93/12. 



In an attempt to mitigate this complexity, the draft ruling seeks to provide a number of examples of when payments may or may not be classified as royalties. These examples are intended to cover a wide range of commercial arrangements in order to provide guidance to a broad range of taxpayers.



Software for ‘simple use’



Previously under TR 93/12, the provision of software for ‘simple use’ was treated as a sale of goods and not considered to be a licence of copyright for tax purposes. At the time that the ruling was issued, software was typically contained on floppy discs and sold in ‘shrink wrapped’ boxes, and therefore the ruling took a pragmatic view based on industry practice at the time.



Since then a number of different digital business models have developed as the concept of 'software' has evolved. Further, software has evolved to be distributed not just through retail physical shops or floppy discs, but more commonly via digital download, e.g. distribution via the internet, or via cloud computing where users use the software in the cloud without downloading the software on to individual devices. Although simple use software can no longer be treated as the sale of goods, the draft ruling still generally treats a payment for ‘simple use’ of software as not being a royalty.



When software-related payments are royalties 



However, the underlying software itself, as well as the rights that end users have to modify and utilise the software, have continued to evolve as the digital economy and its products and services have become increasingly complex.



Under the draft ruling, the ATO has formed a view that certain receipts in respect of software (outside of its physical packaging where available) are considered receipts for intangible/intellectual property, and therefore should be considered a royalty payment.



In particular, the consideration that a type of arrangement may constitute a royalty is linked to payment for “the grant of a right to do something in relation to software that is the exclusive right of the owner of the copyright.” This concept of the “exclusive right of the owner” of the software copyright is the key issue in assessing whether a payment should be considered a royalty.



The position adopted by the ATO in the draft ruling has regard to the Copyright Act 1968 when considering the exclusive rights of the owner. This is a somewhat legal interpretation which in practice will leave taxpayers a far cry from the pragmatic guidance of TR 93/12, which may cause compliance problems for some clients.



Summary of examples



The draft ruling indicates that the character of receipts from the licensing and distribution of software will depend on consideration of all facts and circumstances of the particular case. 



The draft ruling contains a number of examples of what amounts are characterised as royalties (or not) illustrated through various scenarios of software that is developed, modified, used, distributed and serviced. The examples in the draft ruling generally include:





	

		

			

			Item

			

			

			Royalty (Y/N)

			

		

		

			

			Licence to reproduce software

			

			

			Y

			

		

		

			

			Licence to modify software including access to source code

			

			

			Y

			

		

		

			

			Licence for the simple use of software

			

			

			N

			

		

		

			

			Software distribution agreement conferring the right to enter into end user licence agreements (EULA)

			

			

			Y

			

		

		

			

			Software distribution agreement conferring the right to enter into cloud services agreements

			

			

			Y

			

		

		

			

			Software distribution agreement not conferring copyright

			

			

			N

			

		

		

			

			Services ancillary to the modification of software (particularly in an integrated form without services and software being separately priced)

			

			

			Y

			

		

		

			

			Services ancillary to the simple use of software

			

			

			N

			

		

	





Where there is ambiguity in facts or circumstances, the taxpayer should take reasonable care to determine and where appropriate 'apportion' the amount that may be characterised as royalty. 



Date of application



The draft ruling has been released for a month-long consultation period. Comments are due by 23 July 2021.



Once the ruling is finalised, it is intended to apply to before and after its date of issue, except where it conflicts with the terms of settlement of a dispute agreed to before the date of Issue of the Ruling. 



Further, the ATO recognises that TR 93/12 can be relied upon for periods prior to 25 June 2021 to the extent that taxpayers have previously relied on the earlier guidance.



BDO's observations



Australian taxpayers who make software related payments to non-residents, particularly if they have not previously elected to treat those payments as royalties, need to review historic and current arrangements in light of the draft ruling as a matter of priority.



The draft ruling may cause challenges for taxpayers who operate software distribution based activities who have previously been subject to a Multinational Anti Avoidance Law (MAAL) related restructure that resulted in more revenue and expenses sitting onshore. Consequently, Australian royalty withholding tax may now apply to software-related payments to foreign copyright owners. Before the MAAL restructure such payments would have been paid by non-resident entities and not subject to Australian royalty withholding tax.



Given the broad range of fact patterns to which the draft ruling can apply, and the potential royalty withholding tax impact of existing or new software-related payments, please contact your local BDO Tax or Transfer Pricing expert if you may be affected by this draft ruling.

Title: Explorer Quarterly Cash Update: March 2021 
Date: 07 June 2021 
Description: BDO’s latest research into the financial health of Australian-listed explorers for the March quarter of 2021 provides positive signals for the sector, with evidence of a definitive COVID-19 recovery seen from unprecedented levels of financing inflows, a strong cash position and improved investment and exploration spending since early 2020. 



Exploration companies raised $2.37 billion in the March 2021 quarter, up 7 per cent from the $2.21 billion in December. Of those companies, 48 raised funds of $10 million or more and made up 75 per cent of the total funds raised. Of those 48 companies, there were ten gold companies, nine lithium companies, four uranium companies, four rare earth metals companies, four graphite companies and the remaining 17 companies were across 14 different sectors, most notably copper-gold, copper and oil and gas. This resulted in 80 per cent of exploration companies reporting cash balances of $1 million or more, the highest proportion recorded since BDO commenced this analysis in 2013.



Whilst the total amount of funds raised during the quarter showed a slight increase, there is some evidence to suggest that the frequency of capital raises in the sector had slowed with 28 per cent of exploration companies raising $1 million or more, down from 39 per cent and 36 per cent in the September and December 2020 quarters respectively.



The first quarter of 2021 has proven to be a strong start to the year for Australian explorers, and is showing signs of a transition away from mere recovery to a new focus on ESG. The global push for lower carbon emissions and clean energy has put a spotlight on EV-related commodities and greener energy alternatives, which we are already seeing in the March quarter. Australian explorers will need to continue to place greater emphasis on demonstrating a mature approach to ESG matters in their operations to continue capitalising on this trend.

However, the LCR applies retrospectively from 1 January 2019 (including the amendment for state and municipal taxes to be taken into account in working out the rate of foreign income tax).

Title: Board of Taxation Review of CGT Restructure Rollovers 
Date: 15 February 2021 
Description: The Board of Taxation (BoT) recently released a consultation paper as part of its review of the capital gains tax (CGT) restructure rollover rules. The consultation paper sets out the BoT’s first-stage proposal for rationalising and replacing seven current CGT rollovers that deal with common business restructure transactions, including mergers (i.e. takeovers) and demergers with a single principles–based general restructure rollover. The proposed new restructure rollover is designed to be simple, comprehensive and aligned with commercial practices while preserving the important integrity function of CGT. Importantly, it should be noted that the proposed model business restructure rollover has not been endorsed by the Federal Government. It has been written for the sole purpose of enhancing Stakeholders understanding of the preliminary model to facilitate consultation before sending a recommendation to the Federal Government.
